# Penguin Species Classification using SVM and KNN

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that classifies penguin species based on physical and categorical features. Using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), the project aims to accurately predict the species of a penguin.

## Overview

The notebook includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing feature distributions and checking for imbalances.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Applying SMOTE to address class imbalances.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation for optimal SVM and KNN settings.
  - Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.


## Results

The notebook provides insights into each model’s performance and concludes with ROC curves and classification metrics, highlighting SVM’s slightly superior performance.
